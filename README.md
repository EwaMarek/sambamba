# Introduction

Sambamba is a high performance highly parallel robust and fast tool
(and library), written in the D programming language, for working with
SAM and BAM files. Because of its efficiency is an important work
horse running in many sequencing centres around the world
today.

Current functionality is an important subset of samtools
functionality, including view, index, sort, markdup, and depth. Most
tools support piping: just specify `/dev/stdin` or `/dev/stdout` as
filenames. When we started writing sambamba (in 2012) the main
advantage over `samtools` was parallelized BAM reading and writing.
In March 2017 `samtools` 1.4 was released, reaching parity on this. A
[recent performance comparison](https://github.com/guigolab/sambamBench-nf)
shows that sambamba holds its ground and can do better in different
configurations. Here are some comparison
[metrics](https://public-docs.crg.es/rguigo/Data/epalumbo/sambamba_ws_report.html). For
example for flagstat sambamba is 1.4x faster than samtools. For index
they are similar. For Markdup almost 6x faster and for view 4x
faster. For sort sambamba has been beaten generally, though sambamba
is up to 2x faster on large RAM machines.

In addition sambamba has a few interesting features to offer, in particular

- faster large machine `sort`, see [performance](./test/benchmark/stats.org)
- automatic index creation when writing any coordinate-sorted file
- `view -L <bed file>` utilizes BAM index to skip unrelated chunks
- `depth` allows to measure base, sliding window, or region coverages
  - [Chanjo](https://www.chanjo.co/) builds upon this and gets you to exon/gene levels of abstraction
- `markdup`, a fast implementation of Picard algorithm
- `slice` quickly extracts a region into a new file, tweaking only first/last chunks
- and more

Even though Sambamba started out as a samtools clone we are now in the
process of adding new functionality - also in the
[BioD project](https://github.com/biod/BioD). The D language is
extremely suitable for high performance computing. At this point we
think that the BAM format is here to stay for processing sequencing
data and we aim to make it easy to parse and process BAM files.

Sambamba is free and open source software, licensed under GPLv2+.
See manual pages [online](https://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/docs/sambamba-view.html)
to know more about what is available and how to use it.

For more information on Sambamba contact the mailing list (see below).

<a name="help"></a>
# Getting help

Sambamba has a
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sambamba-discussion)
for installation help and general discussion.

## Reporting a sambamba bug or issue

Before posting an issue search the issue tracker and
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sambamba-discussion)
first. It is likely someone may have encountered something
similar. Also try running the latest version of sambamba to make sure
it has not been fixed already. Support/installation questions should
be aimed at the mailing list. The issue tracker is for development
issues around the software itself. When reporting an issue include the
output of the program and the contents of the output directory.

## Check list:

1. [X] I have found and issue with sambamba
2. [ ] I have searched for it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/biod/sambamba/issues) (also check closed issues)
3. [ ] I have searched for it on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sambamba-discussion)
4. [ ] I have tried the latest [release](https://github.com/biod/sambamba/releases) of sambamba
5. [ ] I have read and agreed to below code of conduct
6. [ ] If it is a support/install question I have posted it to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sambamba-discussion)
7. [ ] If it is software development related I have posted a new issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/biod/sambamba/issues) or added to an existing one
8. [ ] In the message I have included the output of my sambamba run
9. [ ] In the message I have included the relevant files in the output directory
10. [ ] I have made available the data to reproduce the problem (optional)

To find bugs the sambamba software developers may ask to install a
development version of the software. They may also ask you for your
data and will treat it confidentially.  Please always remember that
sambamba is written and maintained by volunteers with good
intentions. Our time is valuable too. By helping us as much as
possible we can provide this tool for everyone to use.

## Code of conduct

By using sambamba and communicating with its communtity you implicitely
agree to abide by the
[code of conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/) as
published by the Software Carpentry initiative.

# Compiling Sambamba

Note: in general there is no need to compile sambamba. You can use a
recent binary install as listed above.

The preferred method for compiling Sambamba is with the LDC compiler
which targets LLVM. LLVM versions 6 is faster than earlier editions.

## Compilation dependencies

- git (to check out the repo)
- gcc compiler 4.9 or later (for htslib)
- D compiler 1.7.0 or later (ldc2, see below)
- python2 (parses D-compiler header for version info)
- zlib (library)
- lz4 (library)
- htslib (submodule)
- BioD (source)
- undeaD (source)
- python2

## Compiling for Linux

The LDC compiler's github repository provides binary images. The current
preferred release for sambamba is LDC - the LLVM D compiler (>= 1.6.1). After
installing LDC from https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/ with, for example

```sh
cd
wget https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/download/v$ver/ldc2-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
tar xvJf ldc2-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
export PATH=$HOME/ldc2-1.7.0-linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/ldc2-1.7.0-linux-x86_64/lib
```

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/biod/sambamba.git
cd sambamba
make
```

To build a development/debug version run

```sh
make clean && make debug
```

To run the test fetch shunit2 from https://github.com/kward/shunit2 and put it in the path so
you can run

```sh
make check
```

### GNU Guix

To build sambamba the LDC compiler is also available in GNU Guix:

```sh
guix package -i ldc
```

## Compiling for Mac OS X

Note: the Makefile does not work. Someone want to fix that using the
Makefile.old version? See also https://github.com/biod/sambamba/issues/338.

```sh
    brew install ldc
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/biod/sambamba.git
    cd sambamba
    git clone https://github.com/dlang/undeaD
    make
```

## Development

Sambamba development and issue tracker is on
[github](https://github.com/biod/sambamba). Developer
documentation can be found in the source code and the [development
documentation](https://github.com/biod/sambamba-dev-docs).

<a name="debug"></a>
# Debugging and troubleshooting

## Segfaults on certain Intel Xeons

Important note: some popular Xeon processors segfault under heavy
hyper threading - which Sambamba utilizes.  Please read
[this](https://blog.cloudflare.com/however-improbable-the-story-of-a-processor-bug/)
when encountering seemingly random crashes.

## Dump core

In a crash sambamba can dump a core file. To make this happen set

```sh
ulimit -c unlimited
```

and run your command. Send us the core file so we can reproduce the state at
time of segfault.

## Use catchsegv

Another option is to use catchsegv

```sh
catchsegv ./build/sambamba command
```

this will show state on stdout which can be sent to us.

## Using gdb

In case of crashes it's helpful to have GDB stacktraces (`bt`
command). A full stacktrace for all threads:

```
thread apply all backtrace full
```

Note that GDB should be made aware of D garbage collector:

```
handle SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2 nostop noprint
```

A binary relocatable install of sambamba with debug information and
all dependencies can be fetched from the binary link above.  Unpack
the tarball and run the contained install.sh script with TARGET

```
./install.sh ~/sambamba-test
```

Run sambamba in gdb with

```
gdb -ex 'handle SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2 nostop noprint' \
  --args ~/sambamba-test/sambamba-*/bin/sambamba view --throw-error
```
